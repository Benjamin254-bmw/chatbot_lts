 # 🤖 ChatBot - A Simple Python Chatbot

## 📌 Project Description
ChatBot is a simple, rule-based chatbot built using Python. It responds to user input based on predefined keywords and phrases. This is the first step in building a more advanced AI-powered chatbot.
🔹 Plan for the Chatbot
1️⃣ Basic chatbot – A simple rule-based chatbot using Python.
  ✅ 🚀 Features
  ✔️**Keyword-based responses** - The chatbot replies based on predefined words.
  ✔️ **Predefined answers** - Uses a dictionary to generate responses.
  ✔️ **Fast and lightweight** - No external dependencies required.
  ✔️ **Runs in the terminal** - Runs entirely on your local machine.
  ✔️ **Easy to customize** - You can add more responses and improve interactions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `random` (for randomizing responses)
- **Data Storage:** Dictionary-based storage (can be extended to JSON or a database)

## 📜 How It Works
  1. The user enters a message in the terminal.
  2. The chatbot checks for matching keywords in its predefined responses.
  3. If a match is found, the bot responds accordingly.
  4. If no match is found, it returns a default response.
  5. The conversation continues until the user types `'bye'`.  

## 📌 Installation & Setup
### **🔹 Prerequisites**
Make sure you have **Python 3+** installed.  
Check by running:
```bash
python3 --version


🔹 Clone the Repository

You: Hello
ChatBot: Hi there!
You: What's your name?
ChatBot: I'm ChatBot, your virtual assistant!
You: Bye
ChatBot: Goodbye!


      🌟 Future Improvements
